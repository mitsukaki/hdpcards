# HD Player Cards
Simple Go program that scrapes the Dash League website for player stats.

The end goal of this program is to provide a lightweight local server that
can grab and compute player stats for Dash League casters, and also expose
that data to OBS for streaming.

# Usage
This program currently runs from the terminal/console. To operate it on
windows, unzip the build and run "start.bat".

# Releases
Windows builds are available on the releases page. For other systems, please
reach out to QuessX (mitsu#0001 on Discord), or build it yourself.

# Build Instructions
Make and go are required for this project. To compile it simply run `make`
in the root directory of the repository.
